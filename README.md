## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChadRabbit/YOLOv5_Pip.git
cd YOLOv5_Pip
```
### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, it is recommended to use a virtual environment:

On Windows:

    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Install all necessary Python packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Step 1: Start Jupyter Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook from the terminal:
```
jupyter notebook
```
### Step 2: Open the Notebook

In the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open the file YOLO_pip.ipynb.
### Step 3: Run the Cells

Execute all the cells in the notebook to perform car detection on the input images. The notebook includes instructions and code for running the YOLOv5 model.
